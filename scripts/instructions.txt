How to use for competition (getting it on the pfsense vm)

as long as you are connected to the internet, you can do these two 
commands in the pfsense shell

fetch -o /path/to/directory/where/you/want/files/to/go repo.tar.gz https://github.com/<username>/<repo>/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz

tar -xzf <nameofrepo>.tar.gz


once everything is installed, you can edit the file paths listed
in the importantFiles.txt file as needed. Directories should work 
too, not just files, although I have only really done tests with files
so far.
